# Drawio
In this assignment, your task is to write a drawing application, using JavaScript and HTML5. It
should use the HTML5 canvas element, and use object-oriented design for the JavaScript code.
And you need to use JS objects instead of ES6 classes. A use case for your application could be
for a teacher which wants to use your application instead of a regular whiteboard.
